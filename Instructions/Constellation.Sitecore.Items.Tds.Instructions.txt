Instructions
============

1.	Configure your TDS project to generate code. Leave the template file references blank for now.

2.	Copy the T4Templates\*.tt files to your TDS project. (You can then remove the *.tt files from this project)

3.	In your TDS project's Code Generation tab, specify Constellation.Sitecore.ItemsHeader.tt and Constellation.Sitecore.Items.tt as your template files.

4.	Adjust the Assembly reference in Constellation.Sitecore.Items.tt to point to the folder location for the Constellation.Sitecore.Items.TDS.dll assembly file.

5.	Build this project to create the Constellation.Sitecore.Items.TDS.dll (otherwise code generation will fail).
